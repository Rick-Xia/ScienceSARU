# ScienceSARU
A discord chat bot made in NodeJS and MongoDB.

## Functions:
Mainly designed for myself and my friends, providing convenience for our gaming and daily life such as Rainbow 6 stats querying and weather querying.

To invite the bot, type
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=431893150513102858&scope=bot&permissions=0`
in your url

To check its command list, type
`-help`
in discord

MongoDB support added. Users can now use MongoDB or JSON file for storing player data now, depending on the connection status of MongoDB (as MongoDB is always the first choice).

**May 14th Update: according to the latest GDPR, the R6 API will no longer be permitted to provide/store user data after May 25th. Thus, all rainbow six seige player related functionalities will be inavailable. Let's see how the things turn out in the future**
